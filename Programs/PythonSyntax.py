# This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")

#Docstrings
#Python also has extended documentation capability, called docstrings.

#Docstrings can be one line, or multiline.

#Python uses triple quotes at the beginning and end of the docstring:

#Example
#Docstrings are also comments:

"""This is a 
multiline docstring."""
print("Hello, World!")
